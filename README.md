This personal photography portfolio website is based off of the following template:

https://github.com/JoaoFranco03/photography-portfolio

Develop using npm run dev

Push using:
git add .
git commit -m "message about my commit"
git push origin main

If you want a new branch instead of working directly on main:
git switch -c branchName
git add .
git commit -m "message about my commit"
git push origin branchName
git switch main
git branch -d branchName

Then accept changes at:
